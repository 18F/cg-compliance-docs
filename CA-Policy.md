18F will make a determination of the security impact of changes to the information system and environment of operations;
18F will conduct ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy; and
18F will report security state of the information system to appropriate organizational officials on an annual basis.

### Penetration Testing
18F will employ the use of an independent penetration agent or penetration team to perform penetration testing on its information system or system components
18F if needed will employ authorized red team exercises to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems in accordance with approved rules of engagement.

### Internal System Connections
