## Procedures

As a cloud service provider that is also part of the General Services Agency (GSA), a federal agency, 18F ensures cloud.gov invests in the most comprehensive risk management assessments imaginable.

The main assessment procedures used are the ones that created this document itself: the [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://www.fedramp.gov/). Further, 18F engages an [accredited third-party assessment organization](https://www.a2la.org/appsweb/fedramp.cfm?standpk=131&title=FedRamp&certno=0.68&explain=yes&CFID=8562345&CFTOKEN=2092ae74d77c6326-5E473667-5056-A51D-2C61F063908820F4) (3PAO), to provide an independent review of the system and organizational operations.

Assessments of 18F operations are performed in tandem with vulnerability scanning, malicious user testing, insider threat assessments, and other tests regularly conducted by both the cloud.gov and Infrastructure teams, GSA Information Security, and a 3PAO. The system is also under continuous monitoring from cloud.gov's Cloud Operations team.

18F takes any results seriously, and implements remediations as soon as possible. Plans of action and milestones (POAMs) are maintained to ensure any findings are resolved, compensated for, or accepted as an operational requirement.

See CA-2, CA-2(1), CA-2(2), CA-2(3), CA-5, CA-7, CA-7(1), CA-8, CA-8(1).

The Infrastructure Director for the entire Technology Transformation Service serves as the Authorizing Official for cloud.gov.
