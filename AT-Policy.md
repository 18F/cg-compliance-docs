# Security awareness and training policy

See [CIO 2100.1K â€“ GSA IT Security Policy](https://gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=164806) Chapter 4, _Policy on Operational Controls_, which covers:

* Awareness and Training (AT)

* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
* Personnel Security (PS)

## Purpose

Provide the highest quality training in modern security practices, ensure announcements regarding new risks to information systems circulate immediately, and facilitate collaboration across the Service to develop new technologies or methodologies to compensate risk. 

## Scope

See the **_Applicability_** section of the GSA IT Security Policy.

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the [Technology Transformation Service's (TTS) Common Control Policy](https://github.com/18F/compliance-docs/blob/master/TTS-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

If cloud.gov staff fail to comply with GSA security training requirements, their access to all GSA information systems is terminated. This includes access to cloud.gov systems.

See AT-2, AT-2 (2).

The cloud.gov Program Manager ensures that Cloud Operations staff with significant information system security roles complete role-based security-related training upon being granted access, and subsequent refresher training at least annually.

Whenever a new person joins the Cloud Operations team, the cloud.gov Program Manager assigns the team member a GitHub issue documenting a checklist of required training materials. The same process is applied to each team member annually as if they were a new team member.

See AT-3, AT-4.
