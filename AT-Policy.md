## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the [Technology Transformation Service's (TTS) Common Control Policy](https://github.com/18F/compliance-docs/blob/master/TTS-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

If cloud.gov staff fail to comply with GSA security training requirements, their access to all GSA information systems is terminated. This includes access to cloud.gov systems.

See AT-2, AT-2 (2).

The cloud.gov Program Manager ensures that Cloud Operations staff with significant information system security roles complete role-based security-related training upon being granted access, and subsequent refresher training at least annually.

Whenever a new person joins the Cloud Operations team, the cloud.gov Program Manager assigns the team member a GitHub issue documenting a checklist of required training materials. The same process is applied to each team member annually as if they were a new team member.

See AT-3, AT-4.
