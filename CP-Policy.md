## Purpose

Identify scenarios of likely events that would substantively disrupt the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information system. Use those scenarios to conduct actual simulations of said disruptions, and use data collected from the simulation to iteratively improve training, methodologies, but above all - improve the automation of our information systems to self-heal from any disruptions.

## Scope
